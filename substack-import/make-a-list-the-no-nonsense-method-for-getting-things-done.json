These are generally consistent, meaning you’ll do them more than once in a week or month, so there’s not much need to make a list. The tasks that are urgent and important (like doing your taxes, or getting your kid to school when she missed the bus) often occur in the moment, so it’s not much use to make a predetermined list either. Everything in the “neither (important or urgent)” category like watching the latest episode of Black Mirror, aren’t much priorities, are they? Best to keep them few and far between.",
