From there, you can decide on your top pick by introducing additional filters that are applicable to the decision of choosing a restaurant, such as price, rating, location distance, noise level, dietary options, whether a food blog or magazine wrote something about it recently, etc. Per our example, Penang (the only Malaysian restaurant near me) is in Bethesda, a 30 mile drive through I-95 and I-395 traffic—nope! Okra’s is 25 miles out, and it can be pretty loud on a Friday night (they have a full bar and do live music)—maybe not. Layla’s on the other hand, is quiet, it’s 6 miles away and it has a 4.5 out of 5 star rating on Google reviews-bingo! If however, I’ve been to Layla’s recently, or my date’s really craving fried chicken and I don’t mind driving to Arlington, maybe I’ll consider Tupelo Honey instead.",
