Of course, if your kind the person who benefits from working alongside a cohort of others who are on the same path you are (or if you simply likely being around people), the upside of these courses outweigh the costs.

In other words, if your committed to the career path, are hard working, and don't care much for in-person mentorship, this tier of programs is likely you’re best bet. On the other hand, if you’re just dabbling, or if you’re not wholly sure you want to spend over $5K on a career-change, Udacity and General Assembly might be the best way to go. They don’t offer the same level of mentorship or camaraderie as the others, but they’re good programs that can help you get a solid grasp of the material, and help you discover what you need to know to progress moving forward. They’re also significantly cheaper*, so if you’re merely trying to get your foot in the door and develop some familiarity with the concepts and tools, these are likely your best option. *FYI: 1-3 months of Udacity is a mere fraction of what you’d pay for the same duration for many of the other courses. Which means that if you’re entirely new to the curriculum, you can take it for a month, develop a solid breadth of knowledge, and—if you decide you’re 100% invested—",
