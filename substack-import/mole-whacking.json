This includes fencing (labor-intensive and not effective), baiting the moles (time-consuming and inconsistent), ‘flushing them out’ (hard to do well), and traps (which rarely work and are now illegal). There’s also, of course, ‘whacking the mole’ on the head which works, but it’s also time-consuming and potentially dangerous, plus you then have to then remove it yourself. And then there’s the most common method: stomping their mounds flat—effectively doing nothing—encouraging the moles to simply push the dirt back up.",
